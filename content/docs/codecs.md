# Requirements

**All four of these things need to be true to support hardware accelerated encoding with Owncast.**

1. You are **not** running on a VPS provided to you by a hosting provider, as shared virtual servers do not allow for direct access to hardware.
1. You have compatible hardware and have direct access to it.
1. You installed and configured any drivers and libraries needed to take advantage of your hardware.
1. You have a copy of `ffmpeg` that is version 4.1.5 or greater that is specifically built to utilize these drivers and libraries.

## Things to keep in mind

1. Most people won't be able to take advantage of this unless you're running your own hardware.
1. Just because a specific hardware accelerated codec shows in the Owncast admin **does not mean your machine is configured to support it**.  It simply means Owncast believes that codec to be available.
1. Very little of what is required to get your hardware working has anything to do with Owncast. Any questions you have about your particular hardware should be directed to your hardware manufacturer or whoever provides the drivers and libraries to utilize it.  There's likely a lot of information already online, so please do your research.


## Compatible hardware

### Intel Graphics

If you have Intel integrated graphics you may be able to use it using [VA-API](#va-api).

### Raspberry Pi

If you have a recent Raspberry Pi and using the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md) operating system it's actually quite easy to get Owncast running in a hardware accelerated fashion.  Raspberry Pi OS includes support for [OpenMax](#openmax) (OMX) out of the box and includes a version of `ffmpeg` that is built to support it.

However, this seems to only be true for 32 bit operating systems on a Raspberry Pi, as [omx seems to be deprecated under 64 bit environments](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1366#issuecomment-612902082).

### NVIDIA GPUs

NVIDIA GPUs ship with an on-chip hardware encoder unit often referred to as NVENC. Separate from the CUDA cores, NVENC run encoding workloads without slowing the execution of graphics or CUDA workloads running at the same time.

As of July 2019 Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal, Volta and Turing generation GPUs support hardware encoding. Visit the [NVIDIA GPU Support Matrix](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new#Encoder) to verify your GPU is listed in the "encoder" list.

### AMD GPUs

[VA-API](#va-api) is supported on AMD and ATI GPUs by the [libva-mesa-driver](https://is.gd/ZvSdpo).

## Compatible codecs/libraries

<!-- ### Intel QuickSync

"Intel Quick Sync Video" is the marketing name for the hardware video decoding and encoding features on Intel processors with integrated graphics. Processors with an Intel iGPU can be used to do hardware video encoding as long as you have `libva` installed and the processors iGPU supports the video codec and resolution you want to use.

Follow the instructions on Intel's site on [how to get QuickSync setup on Linux](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/quick-sync-video/quick-sync-video-installation.html).

Links:

- [Setting up QuickSync on Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IntelQuickSyncVideo)
- [Intel Graphics at Linux Reviews](https://linuxreviews.org/Intel_graphics) -->


### VA-API

VA-API (video acceleration API) is a layer to support hardware accelerated encoding on linux.  You need the `libva` library installed for it to work. VA-API is not compatible with ARM chipsets.

Links: 

- [VA-API at Linux Reviews](https://linuxreviews.org/VAAPI)
- [Intel Media Driver for VA-API](https://github.com/intel/media-driver/)


<!-- ### Video4Linux

V4L utilizes the `h264_v4l2m2m` codec if the driver is enabled in your kernel and the tools are enabled on your system. -->

### OpenMAX

OpenMAX is a unified abstraction layer that allows access to hardware that otherwise requires vendor specific APIs.  It will work out of the box on modern Raspberry Pi's running a recent version of the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md) operating system.

Verify your copy of ffmpeg has omx support by looking at the [ffmpeg](#ffmpeg) instructions below. If `h264_omx` is in the list you should be good to go.

### NVIDIA Encoder (nvenc)

Follow the instructions on the [NVIDIA ffmpeg transcoding guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ffmpeg-transcoding-guide/) to install all the required drivers and libraries.  This requires installing a driver from the [NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers), Downloading and install the [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), [downloading nv-codec-headers](https://github.com/FFmpeg/nv-codec-headers), and building ffmpeg.  Scroll to the section entitled _Hardware accelerated transcoding with FFmpeg_ at the [NVIDIA transcoding guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ffmpeg-transcoding-guide/) for more information.

You may be able to find a pre-built version of ffmpeg that has `nvenc` support, however that's outside the scope of this document.  You still need NVIDIA drivers regardless.

## ffmpeg

Once your system is configured to use the correct drivers and libraries required you'll need to make sure your copy of `ffmpeg` supports it.

Verify you have ffmpeg installed that's at least version 4.1.5.

```
$ ffmpeg -version
ffmpeg version 4.1.6-1~deb10u1+rpt1 Copyright (c) 2000-2020 the FFmpeg developers
built with gcc 8 (Raspbian 8.3.0-6+rpi1)
```

Verify the codec you expect to use is enabled in your version of ffmpeg.

```
$ ffmpeg -hide_banner -codecs | grep 264
 DEV.LS h264                 H.264 / AVC / MPEG-4 AVC / MPEG-4 part 10 (decoders: h264 h264_v4l2m2m h264_mmal ) (encoders: libx264 libx264rgb h264_omx h264_v4l2m2m h264_vaapi )
```

If the codec you hope to use is not in this list then you may need to build your own copy of ffmpeg that supports it.
